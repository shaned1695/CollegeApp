# CollegeApp
This program will be a system for college application process. It will consist of a number of classes. These are as follows:  
Application class. Application class will have course_name and course_number
Applicant class. An applicant has a name and an id
Student class. Student class will have an application and an address. Student is an applicant. 
MatureStudent class. A MatureStudent is a student and has a Date_of_Birth. 
StudentTest class, create an array of students which can hold student objects and MatureStudent objects. The user will enter the information in for each object. 

Once the user has entered all the information correctly, they will see the following menu 
1: View Course details
2: Edit course/personal details
3: Quit

If the user chooses 1, the user will be able to view the course name or the course id.
If the user chooses 2, the user will be presented with another menu

1: View application details
2: View personal details
3: Change application details
4: Change personal details
5: Quit

Any changes made to the student/application must update the variables for that object. Write all the objects to a file before the program closes.

Set & get methods will be needed in the first 4 classes.
Validation will be required throughout the system.

The thing I'm most proud of is getting it to write to a file
